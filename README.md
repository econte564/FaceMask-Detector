# FaceMask-Detector
Project developed for University (Data Science Lab).

In this project we train a Convolutional Neural Network(MobileNet V2) to correctly identify faces and, subsequently, extract the region of interest (ROI) and recognize if the subject is wearing a mask.
We also implement Hyperparametere Optimization following three different strategies: Hyperband, Bayesian Opt and Random Search.

The code is enirely reproducible, but in order to actually implement it with your own images and through your webcam to classify the frames in real-time, you need to 
use it locally (this notebook is executed in Google Colab).
